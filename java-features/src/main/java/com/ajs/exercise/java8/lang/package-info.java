/**
 * Java SE 8 adds a relatively small number of new language features 
 * <b>lambda expressions</b>, <b>method references</b>, <b>default and static methods</b> in interfaces, and more widespread use of <b>type inference</b>.
 * Taken together, though, they enable programmers to express their intent more clearly and concisely with less
 * boilerplate, and enable the development of more powerful, parallelfriendly libraries.
